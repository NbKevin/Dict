# Dict
A console dict interface using Youdo dict

This is a python based dictionary.
It provides a console interface to query explanation from Youdao online dictionary (http://dict.youdao.com).

Theoretically I should use a Youdao dict API to realise this function, but I cannot apply for it now since it requires a individual personal website which I do not own.
